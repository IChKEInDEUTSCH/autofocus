# autofocus
auto focus of an video <br>
Every code can indiviually work <br>

  - anaconda, just type ./autofocus.py **'your file path here'**
  - vs code, run your script first,copy command, add a space after .py then paste **'your file path here'**<br>
  should be smth like this C:/.../Python/Python310/python.exe d:/.../autofocus.py C:\..\123.mp4
And yes, it is quite stupid to for force user to give a array in order to use it, nut whatever, I will fixe it later
